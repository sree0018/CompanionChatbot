    "It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child's mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs).",
    "Mental illness affects individuals across all walks of life. From high-income professionals to those experiencing homelessness, no one is immune to its reach. Moreover, mental illness can manifest differently depending on cultural and societal factors. Thus, it's crucial to foster understanding and support for those struggling with mental health challenges, irrespective of their background.",

By investing in mental health resources and destigmatizing discussions around mental illness, we can improve outcomes for individuals and society as a whole."

Additionally, social and cultural factors, such as poverty, discrimination, and access to healthcare, can also play a significant role in mental health outcomes.",
